# Collection
I'm still learning how to use github, so I'm throwing a bunch of random code in here to learn LOL. 
The collection contains a Caesar Cypher Encoder, ripoff Wordle I made for my APCSP class, and a program that prints things weirdly bc I saw it off of tiktok and wanted to challenge myself. :D
